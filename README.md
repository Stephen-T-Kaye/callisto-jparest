# JPA REST

The goal of the project is to provide an easy way to expose resources (JPA entity) over HTTP.

This takes a JPA entity and exposes it in an opinionated fashion as a RESTful API that allows CRUD capability over your entities and
associations. It also exposes a filter parameter for querying resources.

## Features

- Exposes a REST API for your domain model.
- Supports pagination
- Allows to dynamically filter resources.
- OpenAPI documentation for exposed endpoints

## Using Filters

### Overview
JpaRest supports the use of filtering data during retrieval for certain `GET` endpoints.   
These filters should be constructed in accordance with Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as they will then be converted into predicates used to query the database.

### Supported Endpoints
You can provide a filter as a request parameter for `GET` endpoints that return multiple resources.   
The filter expression should be assigned to a request parameter named `filter`.    
Examples of supported endpoints for providing a filter parameter are as follows:
- Getting multiple resources endpoint - `http://localhost:5000/resources/artists`
- Getting multiple related resources for a parent resource - `http://localhost:5000/resources/concerts/37e813a2-bb28-11ec-8422-0242ac120001/artists`


### Forming Expressions
Filter expressions can be formed through the use of logical operators or SpEL method invocation.   
The expression requires an operator and 1 or 2 operands depending on the type of operator.  
Field references are case-sensitive therefore they must exactly match the corresponding field/property on the entity.

#### Logical Operators
When forming a filter expression using logical operators the following conditions must be met:
- The left side operand must be a reference to a field on the entity. Literal values are not supported here.
- The right side operand can be a field reference or a literal value, however the data type of the right    
  side operand must match the data type of the left side operand.
- The following operators are supported: `==, !=, >=, >, <=, <`
- The operators can also be provided in the equivalent (case-insensitive) textual form such as: `eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt`

An example of the filter request parameter using a logical operator is as follows:  
`filter=id == 'dc27d5aa-4e7d-474e-98b6-ebf9aae9a471'`

#### Method References
When forming a filter expression using SpEL method invocation the following conditions must be met:
- Expressions can be formed using either of the following (case-insensitive) method references: `IN, BETWEEN`
- There should be at least 2 parameters passed to the method depending on which one it is.
- The first parameter (LHS) must be a reference to a field on the entity. Literal values are not supported here.
- The parameter/s (RHS) after the first must be literal value/s and their data types must match that of the first parameter.
  - For the  `BETWEEN` method reference there must be exactly two values after the first param.
  - For the `IN` method reference there must be at least 1 value after the first param.

An example of the filter request parameter using method references is as follows:  
`filter=in(id, '27e813a2-bb28-11ec-8422-0242ac120001', '27e813a2-bb28-11ec-8422-0242ac120003')`


### Combining Conditions
There are a few additional logical operators that can be applied and also used to build a filter expression made up of multiple conditions.
- This can be applied with any of the following operators: `&&, ||, !`
- The operators can also be provided in the equivalent (case-insensitive) textual form such as: `and, or, not`

An example of the filter request parameter using additional logical operators is as follows:  
`filter=!in(id, '27e813a2-bb28-11ec-8422-0242ac120001', '27e813a2-bb28-11ec-8422-0242ac120003')`  
An example of the filter request parameter using multiple conditions is as follows:  
`filter=startTime>='2022-10-29T00:00:00+01:00'&&endTime<='2022-10-29T23:59:00+01:00'`


### Comparison Table
| Operator |Textual Version| LHS Operand Type| RHS Operand Type|    
|--|--|--|--|    
| == | eq| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| != | ne| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| >= | ge| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| >  | gt| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| <= | le| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| <  | lt| Field Reference | Field Ref / Literal |    
| IN |   | Field Reference | Literal |    
| BETWEEN  | | Field Reference | Literal |    
| && | and| Expression | Expression |    
| \|\| | or| Expression  | Expression |    
| !| not|  | Expression  |

## Getting Started

The project contains a demo module that contains a simple demo application. The demo
can be run in VSCode by running the `Launch Demo` configuration rom the Run and Debug menu.

If you prefer to run from the command line run

```
./mvnw -pl demo exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="uk.gov.homeoffice.digital.sas.demo.EntitiesApplication"
```

To view the demo open http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/index.html in your browser.

## Tests

The project contains unit tests using JUnit and acceptance test written for cucumber.

To run all tests run
```
./mvnw test
```

To run just the acceptance tests run

```
./mvnw test -pl cucumber-jparest
```

The HTML cucumber report will be output to `./cucumber-jparest/target/cucumber-report.html`
Code coverage reports are found `./jparest/target/site/jacoco/index.html` and `./cucumber-jparest/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Building from Source

JPA Rest can be easily built with the maven wrapper.
You also need JDK 17.

```bash
 $ ./mvnw clean install
```

## Bumping Versions
To update the parent pom version globally throughout the project run the following command.

```bash
  $ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion={version} -f pom.xml
```
When pushing a branch a GitHub action will automatically deploy a snapshot image to github packages. The naming convention for this
is as follows 

```bash
{Version-Number}-{Jira-Reference}-SNAPSHOT
```

## Merging into Main
Once a PR is merged into the main branch the snapshot suffix will be deleted from the version.
The assigned version number will be used to create a version release in Github packages and a Github tag for backup.

## Troubleshooting

### VSCode

#### Lifecycle Commands

Please note that calling lifecycle commands on projects doesn't work correctly for a multi module project.
Instead try calling mvnw with the `-am` option and specify the target module with the `-pl` option.

```bash
$ ./mvnw package -pl demo -am
```


#### JDK configuration

If experiencing build errors check your JDK is configured correctly:

Command + , to open settings.

Search for "java runtime" and click the "Edit in settings.json" link under Java â€º Configuration: Runtimes.

Enter the configuration similar to below. Ensure you specify the correct version name and path to your installed JDK.

```
"java.configuration.runtimes": [

    {
      "name": "JavaSE-17",
      "path": "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
    }
  ]
```
